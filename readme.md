# HeavySleeper
Randomises when you wake up, setting loop time left to a value in a range defined in the mod settings.

Also adds a second mode, 'Light Sleeper', in which the player will always wake up at the start of the loop, but the loop will have a randomised duration, giving a subtly altered experience from the default mode.
